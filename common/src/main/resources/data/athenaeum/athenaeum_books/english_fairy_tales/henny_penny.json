        "One day Henny-penny was picking up corn in the cornyard when--whack!-- something hit her upon the head. \"Goodness gracious me!\" said Henny- penny; \"the sky's a-going to fall; I must go and tell the king.\" So she went along",
        "and she went along and she went along till she met Cocky-locky. \"Where are you going, Henny-penny?\" says Cocky-locky. \"Oh! I'm going to tell the king the sky's a-falling,\" says Henny- penny. \"May I come with you?\" says Cocky-locky. \"Certainly,\" says",
        "Henny-penny. So Henny-penny and Cocky-locky went to tell-the king the sky was falling. They went along, and they went along, and they went along, till they met Ducky-daddles. \"Where are you going to, Henny-penny and Cocky- locky?\" says Ducky-daddles.",
        "\"Oh! we're going to tell the king the sky's a-falling,\" said Henny-penny and Cocky-locky. \"May I come with you?\" says Ducky-daddles. \"Certainly,\" said Henny-penny and Cocky- locky. So Henny-penny, Cocky-locky and Ducky-daddles",
        "went to tell the king the sky was a-falling. So they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till they met Goosey-poosey, \"Where are you going to, Henny-penny, Cocky- locky and Ducky-daddles?\" said Goosey-poosey. \"Oh! we're going to tell",
        "the king the sky's a-falling,\" said Henny-penny and Cocky-locky and Ducky-daddles. \"May I come with you,\" said Goosey-poosey. \"Certainly,\" said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky and Ducky-daddles. So Henny-penny, Cocky-locky,",
        "Ducky-daddles and Goosey-poosey went to tell the king the sky was a-falling. So they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till they met Turkey-lurkey. \"Where are you going, Henny-penny, Cocky- locky, Ducky-daddles, and Goosey-poosey?\"",
        "says Turkey-lurkey. \"Oh! we're going to tell the king the sky's a-falling,\" said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles and Goosey-poosey. \"May I come with you? Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles and Goosey-poosey?\"",
        "said Turkey-lurkey. \"Why, certainly, Turkey-lurkey,\" said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, and Goosey-poosey. So Henny-penny, Cocky- locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey and Turkey-lurkey all went to tell the",
        "king the sky was a-falling. So they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till they met Foxy-woxy, and Foxy-woxy said to Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey and Turkey-lurkey: \"Where are you",
        "going, Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey- lurkey?\" And Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey said to Foxy-woxy: \"We're going to tell the king the sky's",
        "a-falling.\" \"Oh! but this is not the way to the king, Henny- penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey and Turkey-lurkey,\" says Foxy-woxy; \"I know the proper way; shall I show it you?\" \"Why certainly, Foxy-woxy,\" said Henny-penny,",
        "Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey. So Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky- daddles, Goosey-poosey, Turkey-lurkey, and Foxy-woxy all went to tell the king the sky was a-falling. So they went along, and",
        "they went along, and they went along, till they came to a narrow and dark hole. Now this was the door of Foxy-woxy's cave. But Foxy-woxy said to Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey- lurkey:",
        "\"This is the short way to the king's palace you'll soon get there if you follow me. I will go first and you come after, Henny- penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey.\" \"Why of course, certainly, without doubt, why not?\"",
        "said Henny-Penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey. So Foxy-woxy went into his cave, and he didn't go very far but turned round to wait for Henny-Penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey- poosey",
        "and Turkey-lurkey. So at last at first Turkey-lurkey went through the dark hole into the cave. He hadn't got far when \"Hrumph,\" Foxy-woxy snapped off Turkey-lurkey's head and threw his body over his left shoulder. Then Goosey-poosey",
        "went in, and \"Hrumph,\" off went her head and Goosey-poosey was thrown beside Turkey-lurkey. Then Ducky- daddles waddled down, and \"Hrumph,\" snapped Foxy-woxy, and Ducky- daddles' head was off and Ducky-daddles was thrown alongside",
        "Turkey- lurkey and Goosey-poosey. Then Cocky-locky strutted down into the cave and he hadn't gone far when \"Snap, Hrumph!\" went Foxy-woxy and Cocky- locky was thrown alongside of Turkey-lurkey, Goosey-poosey and Ducky- daddles.",
        "But Foxy-woxy had made two bites at Cocky-locky, and when the first snap only hurt Cocky-locky, but didn't kill him, he called out to Henny-penny. So she turned tail and ran back home, so she never told the king the sky was a-falling."
